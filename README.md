# ISO profile for Woof OS

ISO profile for building Woof OS using [`archiso`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso)

## Building the ISO profile into an ISO

If you are on an Arch based system, you can install `archiso` with `sudo pacman -S archiso`.
I'm not sure if you can build this profile on other distributions. Usually impossible.

After installing `archiso`,

- Clone this repository
  `git clone https://github.com/woof-os/iso-profile-xfce4`

- CD into the directory
  `cd iso-profile`

- Build the ISO
  `mkarchiso -v ./archlive`

Now, you can test the iso on your virtual machine.
